# Lend-A-Toolza



## About This Project
### Important to Note
This is an SOA app and needs both this repo (back end) AND [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) ](https://github.com/NickTassinari/lend-a-toolza-fe) (front end) in order to be fully functioning.

### Mod 3 Group Consultancy Project
Lend-A-Toolza is a crowdsourced tool lending library web application. Designed for folks looking to borrow a particular tool within any given area/location. Lend-A-Toolza has the ability for registered users to upload their lendable tool with a picture, a description of the tool and a borrowing period as well as choose to borrow from a list of available tools in their area.

It provides the necessary infrastructure and databases to efficiently handle the large volume of information generated by the app's users.

<b><u>User-generated content management:</u></b> The backend handles the uploading, storage, and retrieval of user-generated content, such as pictures, descriptions, and borrowing period and the tool's status. It ensures efficient data handling and metadata management. The backend enables users to contribute and share their tools, enriching the platform's content and informing the community.

<b><u>Community interaction and engagement:</u></b> The backend supports community-driven features, such as adding tools to be loaned. In the future it will enable users to interact with each other through comments, likes, and replies, fostering a sense of community and encouraging user engagement. The backend ensures smooth communication and real-time updates within the app, enhancing the overall user experience.
